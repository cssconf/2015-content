    <p>We’re going to start CSSconf with relaxed hanging out at <a href="http://www.crackbellmer.de/">Crack Bellmer</a>, a typical Berlin-style bar in Berlin-Friedrichshain. There are two outside areas which allow you to chill and talk to people, or hit the dancefloor after 11pm in the main room. You’re welcome to bring along your friends as well! The event will also be the closing party of our friends from Reject JS, so expect to meet many community members there. Doors open at 8pm.</p>
    <h3>How To Get There</h3>
