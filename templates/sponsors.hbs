        CSSconf EU is a not-for-profit conference dedicated to the creatives and engineers who build the world’s most engaging user interfaces. For the third year in a row, CSSconf EU will gather a diverse audience of more than 400 brilliant developers and designers who share a passion for the design language of the web: CSS. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The talks focus on the latest technologies, cutting edge techniques, and tools. CSSconf creates a platform for the young and evolving CSS community. It bridges the gap between designers and developers and connects experienced professionals with new talent.

        By sponsoring CSSconf EU, you reach an international audience. CSSconf EU is attended by people from all over the world: Germany, US, UK, Sweden, Australia, Russia, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, Netherlands, Denmark, France, Poland, Iran, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Lebanon, India, Canada, Finland, Estonia, Kenya, Japan… CSSconf EU is committed to diversity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our priority is to create a welcoming and safe space. We strive to bring diverse voices on stage, and we are proud to say that we have so far been very successful. For example, in 2013 and 2014, more than 40% of the speakers who appeared on CSSconf EU's stage were female. Every year, those new to public speaking celebrate their debut talks at CSSconf EU. To achieve our goal, we actively encourage new and upcoming speakers, we run free CSS workshops for beginners, we collaborate with tech education initiatives, and we enforce a Code of Conduct. In 2015, we plan to do even better: Our <a href="/diversity-support-tickets/">Diversity Support program</a>  will enable more members of underrepresented groups to attend CSSconf EU. As a sponsor, you can help! <a href="mailto:contact@cssconf.eu">Ask us for ways to get involved</a>!
