    <h1>Diversity Support Tickets</h1>

    <p>CSSconf EU strives to create a genuinely welcoming, safe and inspiring event for the CSS community. This year we’ll offer Diversity Support Tickets to allow an even more diverse audience to participate in the conference.</p>

    <h2>How do Diversity Support Tickets work?</h2>

    <p>You purchase a ticket for yourself, and enable another person of the conference’s choosing to attend the event by paying a share towards their ticket. The support options range from paying 25%, 50% to 100% towards a full ticket. We thank you in advance for your generosity and awesomeness and look forward to a more diverse CSSconf EU than ever before.</p>

    <h2>Why Diversity Support Tickets?</h2>

    <p>Only a diverse community is a healthy community, and we welcome and encourage participation by everyone. Our diversity ticket program is one attempt to increase the number of participants that would love to attend but don‘t have the financial means or the employer to pay for a ticket.</p>

    <h2>Who will receive the sponsored tickets?</h2>

    <p>We collaborate with trusted partner organizations such as <a href="http://opentechschool.org/">OpenTechSchool</a> or <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">RailsGirls</a> to recommend people who would benefit from attending the event. While not perfect, this is our attempt to remove our own bias from selecting people. If you are a non-profit organization working to increase diversity in the web industry and want to collaborate with us, please feel free to reach out via <a href="mailto:contact@cssconf.eu">e-mail</a>.</p>

    <h2>What else are you doing to increase diversity?</h2>

    <p>We operate under a <a href="/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> that we enforce. We educate ourselves and our team about how to put on a safe and inclusive event. We budget for safety, accessibility and diversity, and the Diversity Support Tickets are one attempt to help us improve. We are constantly trying to do better and plan to be as transparent about our process as possible. Watch our website for blog posts as the conference planning comes along.</p>

    <h2>Can I contribute or sponsor in other ways?</h2>

    <p>Help from sponsors is greatly needed – if you are interested in supporting CSSconf EU to become more accessible and inclusive, please reach out to discuss custom options via <a href="mailto:contact@cssconf.eu">e-mail</a>.</p>
