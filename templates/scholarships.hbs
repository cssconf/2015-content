      <p>
        At CSSconf EU, we strive to bring together the most diverse group of people possible — <strong>we firmly believe in equality</strong>, which is why we invite anyone and everyone to participate. In order to make this possible, we are proud to announce our Scholarships Initiative for people who wouldn't otherwise be able to participate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our scholarships fund will support roughly <strong>sixty people</strong> to attend CSSconf EU and/or JSConf EU, and/or Reject.JS. Scholarships <strong>are fully sponsored</strong> (i.e. free) tickets that are awarded after an application process and lottery. Travel expenses and accommodation, if required, will also be awarded.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyone from an under-represented group in tech is invited to apply for a scholarship. This includes, but is not limited to: women, people of colour, LGBTQIA+ people, disabled people, and people facing economic or social hardships.
      </p>
