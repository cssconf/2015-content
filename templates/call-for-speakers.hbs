    <h2>Topics</h2>
    <p>CSSconf EU is targeted at CSS professionals, CSS creatives, CSS aficionados. It doesn’t matter if you are a front end developer since 1999, a creative wizard who practices CSS magic in their spare time, or if you just love CSS and share your knowledge: We’re interested in topics that make us go, “Oh, wow!

      <li>Cutting-edge technological advances in the world of CSS</li>
      <li>Incredible ideas &amp; mind-blowing Hacks</li>
      <li>Scale &amp; Performance</li>
      <li>Architecture &amp; Maintainability</li>
      <li>Tools that improve CSS developers’ lives</li>

      <h1 class="fz-beta">We Can Help</h1>
      <p>Not everybody is a natural talent on stage. Not everybody can produce kick-ass slide-decks. Not everybody is a live-demo god. Not everybody knows they have something great to talk about.</p>
      <p>There are about a million reasons why you don’t consider yourself a speaker.<br/>
        We are here to prove you wrong. If all you have is a gut feeling that you should be on stage, we are here to reach out and help you to develop or hone the skills you think you lack to deliver a great presentation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We are happy to brainstorm your interests to see if a great topic is hiding.</li>
        <li>We are happy to connect you with experienced speakers to help prepare your submission.</li>
        <li>We are happy to review and advise on how to produce a slide deck. If you aren’t feeling creative, you could just use the base template of e.g. <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">reveal.js</a> or <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/">deck.js</a>.</li>
        <li>We are happy to rehearse via video chat with you.</li>
        <li> We can hook you up with local groups so you can practice in front of a friendly crowd.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Again, whatever else you might need, we’re here to help. Get in touch: <a href="mailto:contact@cssconf.eu">contact@cssconf.eu</a> (just don’t use this to submit a proposal).</p>
      <p>If you need more encouragement, check out the website <a href="http://weareallaweso.me/">weareallaweso.me</a>.</p>

    <h2>The Perks</h2>
    <p>If your proposal is selected, here’s what you will get:</p>
    <p><strong>Travel to Berlin</strong>. This usually means we pay for your plane or train ticket, and also cover all transport within the city. We are happy to assist with booking your itinerary, but if you can do it yourself, we can focus on making the conference more awesome.</p>
    <p><strong>Entrance to the conference</strong>. We won’t be done with the speaker selections by the time tickets go on sale, so if you want to make sure you can attend, let us know in the form below and we hold back a ticket for you in case your talk is not selected.</p>
    <p><strong>Accommodation in a hotel</strong> right next to the venue for a day before and after the conference.<br/>
      If you want to stay longer, we can help to arrange things, just let us know. You will have to cover extra nights, though.</p>
    <p>If your employer can cover your travel and hotel, we are happy to list them as a company sponsor. The money we save will be used to make the conference even better.</p>
    <p>You’re welcome to bring your family. If you need childcare, get in touch. We want to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.</p>
    <p>The venue and the hotel will be accessible for wheelchairs and people with reduced mobility. If you have any concerns or questions about whether all your needs will be addressed, please <a href="mailto:contact@cssconf.eu">contact us</a>.</p>
    <h2>The Selection Process</h2>
    <p>Here’s how we select our speakers:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Anonymize submissions, so there is no bias towards the submitter.</li>
      <li>Reviewing and voting of the talks by the conference organizers. Each is rated talk on a scale from 1 to 5. Important criteria are:
        <ul>
          <li>Relevance of the topic for the CSS community</li>
          <li>Coherence and clarity of the proposal</li>
          <li>Novelty of the topic</li>
          <li>Is the topic reasonable to cover in the time we allow</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The top submissions are then de-anonymized so we can bias against speaker details. Based on our budget, we might have to opt for a local or at least closer-by (read: cheaper to transport) speaker.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We expect many more excellent submissions than we have speaking slots. This process helps us to select the best ones, and hack our own unavoidable biases.</p>
    <h2>Guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Language:</strong> All talks are in English.</li>
      <li><strong>Talk Duration:</strong> Talks are 30 minutes long (for longer talks we’ll get in touch with you directly). This includes 3-5 minutes of Q&amp;A. We will be on a tight schedule and will enforce the end of a talk rigorously. We suggest timing your presentation in advance.</li>
      <li><strong>Formatting:</strong> Make sure you care, and make sure we see you care. Typos, sloppy formatting and all-lowercase submissions make our reading of your proposal tedious. These things will not count in favor of your proposal.</li>
      <li><strong>Brevity:</strong> Don’t overdo it either. If you need more than two paragraphs to get to the point of your topic, we will ask you to slim things down. With the amount of submissions we get, the quicker you can to make a good impression the better.</li>
      <li><strong>Original Topics:</strong> One of the things we want to do with CSSconf EU is push the community forward. We can’t do this if the same people talk about the same things all the time. Thus, we favor original content. If you want to present a topic that you have talked about elsewhere, try to add a twist or new research or development — something to make it unique.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Video Recordings</h2>
    <p>We plan to record and publish all talks online for free, along with a recording of the slide deck, live-demo, or other on-presenter-screen activity. We do this for the benefit of the larger CSS community and those who can’t make it to the conference. We hope you want to help out, but if you are uncomfortable about this in any way, let us know and we will work things out.</p>
    <p>Finally, since you retain full ownership of your slides and recording, we’d like to ask you to make your materials and recording available under a Creative Commons (we default to no commercial reuse) or other open source license.</p>
    <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>Our <a href="http://2015.cssconf.eu/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> aims to create a safe and welcoming space for our community members, and to protect every attendee, staff member and speaker from harassment. We thus need you to read, understand and comply with our <a href="http://2015.cssconf.eu/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
    <h2>Submit Your Talk</h2>
    <p>We are looking forward to read it! If you are unsure, don’t know where to start or how to phrase things, or are curious about what makes your proposal stand out: Read our blog post on <a href="http://2014.cssconf.eu/news/how-to-write-a-great-talk-proposal-for-a-tech">how to write a great proposal for a tech conference</a>.</p>
