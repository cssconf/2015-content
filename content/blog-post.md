<h2>Example title of a blog post</h2>
<p>You’ve watched countless talks online. You wrote a blog post, or ten. You went to a local meetup, and maybe even gave a presentation there. You’ve been to conferences, observed people share their knowledge, their stories (or their failures) on stage – and thought to yourself: I should be up there! I have something to talk about!</p>
<p>Well, we think so too! It’s time to get your talk proposals ready for the upcoming conference season, and we have some tips and insights on how to write a compelling talk proposal that will help you to conquer the big conference stages.</p>
<h3>Getting your topic right</h3>
<p>You found a conference that is just for your field, and is looking for just the people with your knowledge. You recently learned something useful while working on a project, spent time researching and comparing new methods to solve a problem, or just have a crazy, fun demo coded up. But now you are not quite sure how to shape a topic out of what you know.</p>
<p>Try thinking of yourself as a conference attendee, and ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What do you want to learn about?</li>
  <li>Which problem(s) need to be solved?</li>
  <li>What makes you curious?</li>
  <li>What would you want to take away from the conference?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Read the Call for Speakers carefully</h3>
<p>Make sure to read the Call for Speakers multiple times. In addition, read about the conference itself on their website, and check out their line-ups from previous events. This will show you which talks made it, and what tone they used to present them.</p>
<p>Weigh your idea against the requirements, and make sure your topic matches all of them, and can be presented within the available time slot.</p>
<h3>Attend meetups</h3>
<p>It can be very hard to judge whether your topic can work in the planned amount of time, and how the audience will react to it. There’s only one advice to this: Go to tech events, and get a feeling for it. Be an attendee, ask speakers you meet there, and start to give talks yourself at local user groups.</p>
<h3>Watch talks online</h3>
<p>If you can’t make it to a conference or there are no groups in your area: Watch talks online. There are amazing talks from great speakers covering a wide range of topics which you can find online, often&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL37ZVnwpeshHAnqFlTxhd0MIXWjLBbM3R">for free</a>. This will also teach you different approaches and angles to present a topic, and get the ideas flowing on how you could tell your story.</p>
<h3>Ask the organizers</h3>
<p>If you are still unsure how to frame your topic, send a quick tweet or email to the organizers: “Hey, I would like to talk about XY at your conference and wanted to check if you think this is interesting to your audience?” If your topic needs adjustments, is too specific or too general or just not the right fit, they will let you know. Bonus: By reaching out, you already demonstrated that you care.</p>
<h3>Translating your topic into a title and an abstract</h3>
<p>Ok, now you know exactly what to talk about. Next step: Translate that into a short and kick-ass abstract. An abstract which stands out and convinces the jury that your talk is not only solid, but is going to inform, entertain and maybe even amaze the audience!</p>
