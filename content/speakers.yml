    talkTitle: The Missing Slice
    talkAbstract: |
      Think of the humble pie chart. Simple and ubiquitous, yet surprisingly
      difficult to create with Web technologies in a flexible, maintainable way.
      Faced with this simple goal, Lea will take you on a colorful interactive
      journey through several aspects of CSS and SVG and will sweep you off your
      feet with clever ways to use them. At the end, you will have your pie and
      animate it too! Do not be fooled: the real takeaway of this talk has
      little to do with pie charts and a lot to do with problem solving via the
      tools the Open Web Platform offers us today.

    talkTitle: The Front End Revolution
    talkAbstract: |
      Claudina's talk will explore events in the history of 
      front end development that have lead to the bouleversement 
      within the field. Despite what you might think, the revolution 
      has nothing to do with the tools and technology. Twitter 
      adoption isn't what started the Arab Spring; Node isn't 
      responsible for JavaScript's renaissance; and Wikipedia's 
      most significant accomplishment has nothing to do with the 
      fact that they are one of the most visited, most trusted, 
      human-powered sites."

    talkTitle: Interoperable CSS
    talkAbstract: |
      There have been a lot of ideas and a lot of speculation about the future
      of CSS in the last year or so, largely driven by the ingenuity of the
      React community. Will we write styling code purely in JS? Will CSS
      continue to be useful? Will someone concoct some X-files-style JS+CSS
      alien-human hybrid language that takes over the world? It’s all possible
      (mostly).

      This talk is about a new format for CSS, one that’s now supported by
      default in Webpack & JSPM, and available with plugins for Browserify.
      It’s called Interoperable CSS, and it hopes to do for CSS what CommonJS
      did for JavaScript.

      modes work and will show us how to implement dynamic and accessible graphics 
      within our own web projects.

      Developing for Localization: CSS Techniques To Get Your Message Across To
      The World Wide Web
    talkAbstract: |
      As a developer for Getty Images whose site is localized into more than 20 languages, 
      Katie is all too familiar with the layout havoc caused by translated content. 
      In her talk, Developing for Localization, she will demonstrate CSS techniques 
      to get your message across the world wide web. From easy wins such as non-embedded 
      image copy to sneaky replacements for padding and margin to buff up those grids, 
      you'll learn robust techniques for your day-to-day CSS development!

    talkTitle: It's All Just Functions And Variables
    talkAbstract: |
      Michael’s talk, It's All Just Functions And Variables, 
      will tell the story of how weeks of being taunted by nonsensical 
      compiler errors and a supportive community turned him, a "lowly" 
      front end developer, into a core contributor to LibSass - a large C/C++ project. 
      He will unravel the stigma that "front end developers aren't real programmers" which 
      propagates throughout the industry and into the hearts and minds of fellow developers.

      Michael will convince you that regardless of whether you write CSS, 
      JavaScript or COBOL, you are as much a programmer as anyone on your 
      team or the intenet, and that it's not our languages that define us 
      but our willingness to learn to master our domain.

    talkTitle: Enhancing Responsiveness With Flexbox
    talkAbstract: |
      Flexbox and responsive web design go great together, like peanut butter
      and jelly! Flexbox gives you more control over the things you care about
      in a responsive layout and lets you create much morecomplex and reliable 
      layouts than you can with floats, table display, or inline-block. 
      All with far less CSS.

      In this talk, you’ll learn what flexbox features are particularly
      suited to responsive layouts and how you can harness them by
      applying flexbox as a progressive enhancement. We’ll look at examples of
      responsive page components and patterns that you can enhance further by
      layering flexbox on top of other layout methods, ensuring all users get a
      good experience.
