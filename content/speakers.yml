    talkTitle: The Missing Slice
    talkAbstract: |
      Think of the humble pie chart. Simple and ubiquitous, yet surprisingly 
      difficult to create with Web technologies in a flexible, maintainable way. 
      Faced with this simple goal, Lea will take you on a colorful interactive 
      journey through several aspects of CSS and SVG and will sweep you off your 
      feet with clever ways to use them. At the end, you will have your pie and 
      animate it too, but do not be fooled: the real takeaway of this talk has 
      little to do with pie charts and a lot to do with problem solving via the 
      tools the Open Web Platform offers us today.

    talkTitle: Interoperable CSS
    talkAbstract: |
      Most people aren’t aware just what an achievement CommonJS was and the 
      true extent of its impact. It took a language that only ran in browsers, 
      had no concept of separate files, used global variables and a single 
      global DOM to communicate; and built something viable, then something 
      thriving, then something dominant. All by adding only a couple of pieces 
      of syntax and a new mental model.

      There have been a lot of ideas and a lot of speculation about the future
      of CSS in the last year or so, largely driven by the ingenuity of the
      React community — will we write styling code purely in JS? Will CSS
      continue to be useful? Will someone concoct some X-files-style JS+CSS 
      alien-human hybrid language that takes over the world? It’s all possible 
      (mostly).

      This talk is about a new format for CSS, one that’s now supported by 
      default in Webpack & JSPM, and available with plugins for Browserify. 
      It’s called Interoperable CSS, and it hopes to do for CSS what CommonJS 
      did for JavaScript.

    talkTitle: 'Photoshop is Dead!: Editing Images in CSS'
    talkAbstract: |
      "Photoshop is the most popular photo editing program of today, but it’s 
      big, slow, and has a learning curve, not to even mention its price. 
      Enter: the browser. With CSS blend modes, gradients, and SVG filters, 
      you could pretty much do most of Photoshop’s common functions right in 
      the browser.

      This talk will go through some common photo editing tasks, from the 
      pragmatic (cropping images, masking) to special effects (vignettes, blurs, 
      colorizing) and show the audience how to do them in the browser!"

      Developing for Localization: CSS Techniques To Get Your Message Across To
      The World Wide Web
    talkAbstract: |
      Although headquartered in the USA, the Getty Images website is localized
      into more than 20 languages, and the translated content can be half again 
      as long as the original. The resulting layout havok includes side-by-side 
      copy headlines of differing heights, strange centering and grid-breaking 
      content boxes. So, how do they build truly flexible layouts?

      Katie will demonstrate CSS techniques for easy wins like non-embedded image 
      copy and double-centered headlines. She’ll show sneaky replacements for 
      padding and margin to buff up those grids. And she’ll finish with real 
      world use cases for flexbox, with fallbacks! By examining at techniques 
      for handling the extreme variations of multiple languages, you’ll learn 
      robust techniques for your day-to-day CSS development.

    talkTitle: Emotion Through CSS
    talkAbstract: |
      Through CSS animation we can bring personality to interactions. Buttons 
      can be impatient or happy. A sliding panel can be eager to open. An input 
      field impatient. Emotion is a powerful thing we can use to connect to 
      users. In this talk I’ll explore why this is important and how to start 
      creating emotion through CSS.

    talkTitle: Fun.css

      Almost every day, we sit down and code, or look at code, or at the very
      least browse through the internet. If there’s one thing that I find
      consistent in the world of web development, its a random seriousness when
      discussing our art… I want to take that away.

      Fun.css is a talk exploring some of the stranger areas of the internet, 
      and some of the stranger techniques and ways of thinking that we can use 
      to create more friendly, and at the very least, more interesting experiences.

    talkTitle: Enhancing Responsiveness with Flexbox
    talkAbstract: |
      Flexbox and responsive web design go great together, like peanut butter
      and jelly. Flexbox gives you more control over the things you care about
      in a responsive layout—like order, alignment, and proportional sizes of
      your boxes—and lets the browser figure out the rest—the math-y stuff that
      computers are good at, like the exact dimensions that are needed on the
      boxes to perfectly fill the available space. You can create much more
      complex and reliable layouts with flexbox than you can with floats, table
      display, or inline-block, all with far less CSS.

      In this talk, you’ll learn which features of flexbox are particularly
      suited to responsive layouts and how you can harness them today by
      applying flexbox as progressive enhancement. We’ll look at examples of
      responsive page components and patterns that you can enhance further by
      layering flexbox on top of other layout methods, ensuring all users get a
      good experience.
